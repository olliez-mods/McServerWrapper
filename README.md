This allows you to get chat, send chat, and commands to a Minecraft server running this Wrapper.
To setup:
Make sure Python 3.x is installed and running on your system (There are a lot of great youtube tutorials for this)
Copy Wrapper.py into your minecraft folder.
Open Wrapper.py to configure, the options are at the top of the file in the CONFIG section. 
You can change the Min and Max ram usage.
Set the name of your server jar file (default is server.jar).
The KEY field should be left blank until you run it for the first time, it will give you instrctions on what you should put there.
Port should remain unchanged (default: 25564) if you plan on using this with the McWrapper Discord bot.
Make sure if you are using the Discord bot, or plan for this to be accessable outside your local network to port forward "25564" as well as minecraft's "25565"

To Run:
Instead of running a .bat file, or double clicking the .jar file, you will open a command prompt, and run "python3 Wrapper.py" (Some installations may use "python" instead of "python3").
You will now see the minecraft server starting up in command prompt, you can use it like regular, however it will be listening on port 25564, for connections.
